# Question 9 | Pod -> Deployment

In Namespace pluto there is single Pod named holy-api. It has been working okay 
for a while now but Team Pluto needs it to be more reliable.

Convert the Pod into a Deployment named holy-api with 3 replicas and delete the 
single Pod once done. The raw Pod template file is available at 
/opt/course/9/holy-api-pod.yaml.

In addition, the new Deployment should set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false and 
privileged: false for the security context on container level.

Please create the Deployment and save its yaml under 
/opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml

## Weight: ~6%
