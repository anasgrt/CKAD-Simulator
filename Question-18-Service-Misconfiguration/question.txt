# Question 18 | Service misconfiguration

There seems to be an issue in Namespace mars where the ClusterIP service 
manager-api-svc should make the Pods of Deployment manager-api-deployment 
available inside the cluster.

You can test this with "curl manager-api-svc.mars:4444" from a temporary 
nginx:alpine Pod. Check for the misconfiguration and apply a fix.
