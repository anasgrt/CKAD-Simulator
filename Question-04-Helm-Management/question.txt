# Question 4 | Helm Management

Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:

1. Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1
2. Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart available
3. Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. 
   The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install
4. There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-install state. 
   Find it and delete it

## Weight: ~5%
## Domain: Application Deployment

NOTE: This question requires helm to be installed. 
Using bitnami charts as substitute for killer.sh charts.
