# Question 7 | Pods, Namespaces

The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver 
from Team Saturn. The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of 
the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce 
system is called my-happy-shop.

Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune. 
It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again.
