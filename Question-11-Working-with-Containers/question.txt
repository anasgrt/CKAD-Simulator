# Question 11 | Working with Containers

There are files to build a container image located at /opt/course/11/image.
The container will run a Golang application which outputs information to stdout.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Change the Dockerfile: set ENV variable SUN_CIPHER_ID to hardcoded value 
   5b9c1065-e39d-4a43-a04a-e59bcea3e03f

2. Build the image using docker, tag it localhost:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker 
   and push it to the registry

3. Build the image using podman, tag it localhost:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman 
   and push it to the registry

4. Run a container using podman, which keeps running detached in the background, 
   named sun-cipher using image localhost:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman

5. Write the logs your container sun-cipher produces into /opt/course/11/logs

NOTE: Requires Docker and/or Podman installed. Registry needs to be available.
